{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this Kernel I'd like to share a couple of ideas which I found on Kernels myself:\n - adversarial validation\n - shakeup simulation\n\nOriginals where I've first seen these ideas implemented:\n - [Quora adversarial validation](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/quora-adversarial-validation) by Bojan Tunguz\n - [Quora shake-up simulation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion/78952#463246) by some other master\n \n##  Adversarial validation\n \nThe idea of adversarial validation is to forget targets at all, concatenate training and test features, and label train instances with 1s and test instances - with 0s. Then we perform cross-validation, and finally see whether a model can distinguish train from test (if in such classification setting scores are pretty high) or not. \n - In the first case we can identify features (via weights/feature importances) which help to distinguish train from test. Such features are \"suspicious\" - their distribution has most likely changes in the test set as compared to the training set. These features deserve special investigation (see [this example](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/ms-malware-adversarial-validation), again by Bojan Tunguz, from that funny [MS malware competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/))\n - In the second case the model can not distinguish train from test just based on the provided features, that's a good sign"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"14467d4ccb21360c1d699d0275b87f234f30c961","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"PATH_TO_DATA = '../input/'\n\ndf_train_features = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(PATH_TO_DATA, \n                                             'train_features.csv'), \n                                    index_col='match_id_hash')\ndf_test_features = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(PATH_TO_DATA, 'test_features.csv'), \n                                   index_col='match_id_hash')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We concatenate training and test sets, only features, no targets whatsoever."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.concat([df_train_features, df_test_features])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"New target is just a binary feature indicating training instances:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"is_train = [1] * len(df_train_features) + [0] * len(df_test_features)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Grab just basic RF model and perform 5-fold cross-validation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, n_jobs=4, random_state=17)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=17)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nadv_validation_scores = cross_val_score(model, df, is_train, cv=skf, n_jobs=4,\n                                       scoring='roc_auc')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see \"nice\" AUCs around 51-52%.
